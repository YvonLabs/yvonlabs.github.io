# Privacy Policy  
**Effective Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Maintained by:** YvonLabs - yvonlabs.plentiful987@passmail.net  

---

### Overview
YvonLabs builds small, independent browser utilities that run entirely on your device.  
We never collect analytics, usage data, or personal information. All processing occurs locally, in your browser.

This unified privacy policy applies to all YvonLabs products, including:  
- **ToastKit** - one-click site reset (cookies, cache, permissions)  
- **HeaderCheck** - HTTP header and privacy posture analyzer  

Future extensions published by YvonLabs will also follow these same privacy principles.

---

### Data Collection
- No personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted.  
- No telemetry, analytics, or diagnostics are performed.  
- No external network requests are made outside normal browser APIs.  
- All actions (clearing data, scanning headers, computing scores) occur within your browser session.  

---

### Permissions
Each extension requests only the minimal permissions required for its core feature set.

| Extension       | Permissions                 | Purpose                                                                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| **ToastKit**    | `browsingData`, `activeTab`, `storage` | Clear cookies, cache, and permissions for the active domain only |
| **HeaderCheck** | `declarativeNetRequest`, `activeTab`   | Inspect HTTP response headers for the current tab.               |

YvonLabs products do **not** access or share data with any third-party service or remote endpoint.

### Third-Party Services
No YvonLabs product integrates with analytics, ads, or external SDKs.  
There are **no** calls to Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, Cloudflare Beacon, or equivalent services.  
All products are built for privacy and transparency.
