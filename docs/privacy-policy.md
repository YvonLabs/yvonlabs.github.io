# Privacy Policy  
**Effective Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Maintained by:** YvonLabs - yvonlabs.plentiful987@passmail.net  

---

### Overview
YvonLabs builds small, independent browser utilities that run entirely on your device.  
We never collect analytics, usage data, or personal information. All processing occurs locally, in your browser.

This unified privacy policy applies to all YvonLabs products, including:  
- **ToastKit** - one-click site reset (cookies, cache, permissions)  
- **HeaderCheck** - HTTP header and privacy posture analyzer  
- Future YvonLabs tools or sites operating under the same principles

---

### Data Collection
YvonLabs projects do **not**:
- Collect or transmit personally identifiable information  
- Log user activity or browsing history  
- Send any data to remote servers or third-party APIs  
- Use cookies or persistent tracking

All actions - such as clearing data, computing a score, or rendering UI elements â€” occur entirely within your browser or device session.

---

### Permissions
Each tool requests only the minimal permissions necessary for its local function.

| Project | Permissions | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **ToastKit** | `browsingData`, `activeTab`, `storage` | Reset cookies, cache, and permissions for the current domain only |
| **HeaderCheck** | `declarativeNetRequest`, `activeTab` | Inspect HTTP headers for the current page |
| **Web Projects** | n/a | Static content only, no active data collection

YvonLabs projects never use these permissions for analytics, telemetry, or remote communication.

---

### Third-Party Services
YvonLabs products do **not** integrate with third-party analytics, ad networks, or telemetry frameworks.  
No calls are made to services such as Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, or other tracking endpoints.  

All assets and operations are hosted on privacy-respecting infrastructure and are transparent in their repositories.

---

### Stay Updated
This policy may evolve to reflect product or regulatory changes.  
The latest version will always be available at:
